# UC Ultimate Commander application.

Welcome to our file manager application, which was created to meet your file browsing and file transferring needs. Our application has two panes that allow you to easily traverse directories and copy files between them. We have made sure that our file manager has excellent keyboard functionality so that you can accomplish your file tasks with ease. While we have designed our application to look good, our primary focus is on functionality. Our goal was to create an application that not only helps you to manage your files but also serves as a platform for testing socket features while highlighting the possibilities for others in similar situations. We drew inspiration from Total Commander, considering their vast range of features that proved useful in the creation of our technologically advanced MVP.
